# This script will be called by dibbler-server with a single parameter
# describing operation (add, update, delete, expire)
# parameters add,update will cause adding a new rule in the main routing table 
# and in the gw routing table (table 3) while parameters del,expire will remove 
# the relevant rule from both tables.
# add/delete entries to/from the routing table is done both to the main table and to table 3
# which is the gateway's routing table. for packets going in the upstream direction , table 3 will route them to
#the correct path. for packets going to the downstream direction - the main table will route them to their destination.
